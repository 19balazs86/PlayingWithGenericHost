# Playing with GenericHost
This console application is an example of utilizing the `GenericHost` as a known `WorkerService`.

[Separate branch](https://github.com/19balazs86/PlayingWithGenericHost/tree/netcoreapp2.2) with the .NET Core 2.2 version.

#### What is the HostBulder?
- `HostBuilder` is a lightweight version of the `WebHostBuilder` and it does not process HTTP requests.
- `HostBuilder` similarly like the `WebHostBuilder`, allows to configure services, using [dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ie/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection), [HttpClientFactory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ie/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests), [logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ie/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging) + [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-extensions-hosting) and so on.

#### Run this application as a Windows Service
1. Publish the application with the predefined PublishAsWinService.pubxml (c:\svc)
2. Run the WinServiceCommands.bat file (create, start, stop, delete functions)

#### Examples
- PrinterService: a simple example of using `BackgroundService` as a base class.
- FileWriterService: a simple example of using `IHostedService` and a Timer in it.
- `Quartz`: using the [Quartz-scheduler / Quartz.NET](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/) to create background process timing with cron expression.
- Use the `System.Threading.Channels` library to create a bounded channel/in-memory queue by utilizing IAsyncEnumerable.
